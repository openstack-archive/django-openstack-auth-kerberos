==============================

django-openstack-auth-kerberos provides a way to extend `django-openstack-auth
<https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth>`_ to allow kerberos login
via S4U2 Proxy. It separates the code and additional dependencies required so
that they are not required as part of the base DOA requirements.

For installation instructions please consult the docs.
